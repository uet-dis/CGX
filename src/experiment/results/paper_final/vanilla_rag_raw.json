Pg 156Explanation:Kawasaki disease is associated with hydrops of gallbladder.Gallbladder Wall Thickening A gallbladder wall that is thickened is a sign of inflammation. This is a non-specific finding, and many other pathologic processes, as well as a postprandial gallbladder, can give you falsely elevated measurements.It is important to measure the wall of the anterior gallbladder surface because of the acoustic enhancement artifact mentioned.Because sound waves travel through a fluid-filled structure, no attenuation occurs. Thus, when those sound weaves hit the back of the gallbladder, they will be so strong that they will obscure an accurate picture of the wall thickness.For gallbladder wall thickness, greater than 3 mm is abnormal.Differential for Thickened Gallbladder WallPostprandialRenal failureAscitesHepatitisHypoalbuminemiaHIV/AIDSAdenomyomatosisMultiple myelomaCholecystitisCongestive heart failure",

      "question": "An ill 16 days old baby girl is brought to the emergency. On examination pallor and dyspnoea present with a respiratory rate of 85 per minute. Her HR is 200 bpm, hea sounds are distant and a gallop is heard. X-ray showed cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram shows dilated ventricles and dilation of the left atrium. An ECG shows ventricular depolarization complexes that have low voltage. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. CHF | B. Glycogen storage disease | C. Pericarditis | D. Aberrant left coronary aery arising from pulmonary aery",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the most likely diagnosis for the 16-day-old baby girl is **A. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Cardiomegaly and Dilated Ventricles/Left Atrium:** The X-ray showing cardiomegaly and the echocardiogram revealing dilated ventricles and left atrium are strong indicators of heart muscle dysfunction and enlargement, consistent with heart failure [5].\n*   **Dyspnea and Tachypnea:** The baby's dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and high respiratory rate (85 per minute) are classic signs of the body struggling to get enough oxygen due to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively, a hallmark of CHF.\n*   **Tachycardia:** The heart rate of 200 bpm is significantly elevated, which is the heart's attempt to compensate for reduced pumping efficiency in CHF.\n*   **Pallor:** Pallor (paleness) can be a sign of poor circulation, also associated with CHF.\n*   **Distant heart sounds and gallop:** These findings can be indicative of a weakened heart muscle and abnormal filling patterns, which can occur in CHF.\n*   **Low voltage ventricular depolarization complexes on ECG:** While the context doesn't explicitly link low voltage to CHF, it suggests an underlying issue with the heart's electrical activity and muscle mass, which can be compromised in severe heart failure.\n\nWhile the context mentions \"abnormal rhythm of the heart\" [2], the constellation of symptoms and findings points more broadly to a failure of the heart to pump adequately, which is CHF. The other options are less supported by the provided information:\n\n*   **Glycogen storage disease:** This is not mentioned in the context.\n*   **Pericarditis:** This is an inflammation of the sac around the heart and typically presents with chest pain, friction rub, and often a different ECG pattern. The context doesn't provide information to support this.\n*   **Aberrant left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery:** While this is a congenital heart defect that can lead to heart failure, the specific ECG finding of low voltage ventricular depolarization complexes is not directly linked to this condition in the provided text.\n\nThe description in [5] about an \"autosomal dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy\" causing \"ventricular ectopy, left ventricular dilation, heart failure, and early death\" shares some similarities with the presented case (ventricular dilation, heart failure, early death), but the specific genetic cause and ECG findings are not fully detailed to definitively diagnose this specific condition over general CHF. However, CHF is a broader category that encompasses the symptoms described.",
      "ground_truth": "CHF || In CHF pallor, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia and cardiomegaly are common regardless of the cause.The most common causes of CHF in children include myocarditis caused by adenovirus and coxsackievirus B.The echocardiogram shows ventricular and left atrial dilatation as well as poor ventricular function. With glycogen storage disease of the hea muscle thickening would be expected. With pericarditis- pericardial effusion is seen. On ECG, the voltages of the ventricular complexes seen with aberrant origin of the left coronary aery are not diminished, and a pattern of myocardial infarction can be seen. *",

      "ground_truth": "Can be diagnosed intrauterine || Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions.ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U/L and for female is 10-28 U/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign.NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU/L. It is moderately increased in hepatitis and highly elevated in biliary obstruction.# Unlike ALP, the level is unrelated with osteoblastic activity and therefore unaffected by bone disease.GAMMA GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE (GGT)# The old name was gamma glutamyl transpeptidase.# It can transfer gamma glutamyl residues to substrate.# In the body it is used in the synthesis of glutathione.# It is seen in liver, kidney, pancreas, intestinal cells and prostate gland.",

Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",

      "question": "A male patient 56 year old complains of swelling in legs. He is a known case of hypertension and is under treatment. On general physical examination pitting oedema is seen on legs and TSH level 3mU/L. Which of the following is not a cause of this condition? A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure | B. Decreased colloid osmotic pressure | C. Due to lymphatic obstruction | D. Myxedema",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, let's analyze the potential causes of swelling in the patient's legs:\n\n*   **Pitting edema** is defined as swelling due to excessive fluid accumulation under the skin, characterized by a persistent indentation when pressure is applied [1]. This can be caused by systemic conditions like heart failure, liver failure, or kidney failure, as well as local conditions affecting the extremities [1]. Swelling due to excessive fluid accumulation in the extremities is also described [2].\n\nNow let's consider the options in relation to the patient's presentation and the provided context:\n\n*   **A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure:** Impaired cardiac function or heart failure can lead to an increase in venous and capillary pressure, resulting in swollen legs [3]. This is a plausible cause of edema.\n*   **B. Decreased colloid osmotic pressure:** While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets, a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure (often due to low protein levels, which can be seen in liver or kidney disease) can lead to fluid shifting out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema. This is a known mechanism for edema formation.\n*   **C. Due to lymphatic obstruction:** Local conditions affecting the extremities can cause swelling [1]. Lymphatic obstruction is a known local cause of edema.\n*   **D. Myxedema:** Myxedema is a severe form of hypothyroidism where there is an accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the skin and edema [5]. The patient's TSH level is 3 mU/L. While this is within the typical reference range for TSH (often around 0.4-4.0 mU/L), it is not definitively indicative of myxedema. However, the question asks what is *not* a cause. Myxedema *is* a cause of edema.\n\nThe question asks which of the following is *not* a cause of this condition. All options A, B, C, and D are recognized causes of edema. However, without further information or a more comprehensive set of options, it's difficult to definitively exclude one.\n\nGiven the provided context, and assuming the question is designed to test understanding of common edema mechanisms, let's re-evaluate. The context directly links heart failure to increased hydrostatic pressure and swollen legs [3]. Lymphatic obstruction is mentioned as a local cause [1]. Myxedema is explicitly stated as causing edema [5]. Decreased colloid osmotic pressure is a fundamental mechanism of edema formation, even if not explicitly detailed in these specific snippets.\n\nIf we are forced to choose one that is *least* directly supported or potentially less likely given the TSH level, it would be Myxedema, as the TSH is not clearly abnormal. However, the question asks what is *not* a cause, and myxedema *is* a cause.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question implies a scenario where one of these is *not* the primary or contributing cause in *this specific patient*. The patient has hypertension, which is a risk factor for heart failure, making increased hydrostatic pressure a strong possibility.\n\nWithout additional context or clarification on the intended scope of the question, it's challenging to definitively select an answer that is *not* a cause. However, if we interpret the question as asking which of these is *least likely* to be the cause given the limited information, and considering the TSH level is not indicative of severe hypothyroidism, then Myxedema might be considered.\n\nHowever, to strictly answer \"which is *not* a cause,\" all listed are potential causes of edema. There might be an error in the question or the provided options if one is intended to be definitively excluded as a cause of edema in general.\n\nLet's assume there's a nuance we're missing or a common understanding of these conditions that the question relies on.\n\nRevisiting the context:\n*   [1] mentions systemic conditions (heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure) and local conditions affecting extremities.\n*   [3] links impaired cardiac function/heart failure to increased hydrostatic pressure and swollen legs.\n*   [5] links myxedema to edema.\n\nIf we consider the TSH level of 3 mU/L, it is generally considered within the normal range. Therefore, myxedema, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism, might be less likely to be the *primary* cause in this patient compared to other options. However, it is still a cause of edema.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is flawed or requires external medical knowledge beyond the provided snippets.\n\nGiven the constraints, and focusing on what is *explicitly* stated as a cause of edema in the context:\n*   Increased hydrostatic pressure (due to heart failure) is a cause [3].\n*   Myxedema is a cause [5].\n*   Local conditions affecting extremities (which could include lymphatic obstruction) are causes [1].\n*   Decreased colloid osmotic pressure is a general mechanism of edema, though not explicitly detailed here.\n\nIf we must choose one that is *not* a cause, and all are generally recognized causes of edema, there might be an intended distinction.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking which of these is *not* a cause of the *specific type of pitting edema* seen in this patient, or which is *least likely* given the TSH.\n\nGiven the TSH level of 3 mU/L, myxedema is less likely to be the primary driver of the edema compared to conditions that would cause increased hydrostatic pressure (like heart failure, which is a common comorbidity with hypertension) or lymphatic obstruction.\n\nTherefore, if forced to choose the option that is *least likely* to be the cause in this specific patient, it would be Myxedema due to the normal TSH. However, the question asks what is *not* a cause.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is asking about a condition that *cannot* cause pitting edema. All listed can cause pitting edema.\n\nThere seems to be an issue with the question or options provided, as all are generally recognized causes of edema. However, if we are to select the *least likely* cause given the patient's TSH, it would be Myxedema. But the question asks what is *not* a cause.\n\nLet's assume there's a subtle distinction. The context for myxedema [5] mentions \"accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the SKIN and EDEMA, known as MYXEDEMA.\" This implies a specific type of edema.\n\nWithout further clarification or context, it is difficult to definitively answer. However, if we are forced to pick one that is *not* a cause, and all are generally causes, there might be an error.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is asking which of these is *not* a cause of *generalized* edema, but the patient has pitting edema in the legs, which can be localized or generalized.\n\nGiven the provided context, and the common understanding of edema, all options A, B, C, and D are potential causes of edema. If one must be selected as *not* a cause, there is likely an error in the question or options.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question as \"which of the following is *least likely* to be the cause in this specific patient given the TSH level,\" then Myxedema would be the answer. But this is not what the question asks.\n\nLet's assume there's a misunderstanding of the question's intent. If the question is asking which of these is *not* a mechanism of edema formation, then all are mechanisms or conditions leading to edema.\n\nGiven the provided context, and the direct statements within it:\n*   Heart failure leads to increased hydrostatic pressure and swollen legs [3].\n*   Myxedema leads to edema [5].\n*   Local conditions affecting extremities can cause swelling [1].\n\nThe question asks what is *not* a cause. This implies one of the options is definitively not a cause of edema.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the question is poorly phrased and intends to ask which is the *least likely* cause. In that case, Myxedema would be the answer due to the normal TSH.\n\nHowever, if we strictly adhere to \"not a cause,\" and all are recognized causes, then the question is unanswerable from the provided context alone.\n\nLet's assume there's a trick or a very specific interpretation.\n\nGiven the TSH level of 3 mU/L, it is within the normal range. Myxedema is a condition of *abnormally low secretion of thyroid hormones* [5]. Therefore, in a patient with a normal TSH, myxedema is not the cause.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
      "ground_truth": "Myxedema || Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of ﬂuid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised ﬂuid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised ﬂuid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others). <NL> Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular. Most of the remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the body’s water is in blood plasma. As noted earlier, edema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. <NL> <NL> Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg. <NL> Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation. <NL> Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces. <NL> <NL> <NL> Reference:Davidson’s Internal Medicine 23rd edition, page no.186",

The other options (Encainide, Flecainide, Beta-blockers) are antiarrhythmic medications, but ICDs are often preferred for primary prevention or treatment of recurrent VT in patients with significant heart disease due to their ability to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias [1, 2, 3, 4].",

The context describes several mitochondrial disorders [1, 2] but does not detail the specific inheritance patterns of mitochondrial DNA.\n\nMitochondrial inheritance is typically maternally inherited, meaning that offspring inherit mitochondria only from their mother. Therefore, if a female is affected with a mitochondrial disease, all of her offspring are likely to be affected.

Pompe disease**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II)** is a lysosomal storage disorder that can manifest in infancy with severe cardiac involvement, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (leading to concentric LVH) and heart failure [1]. Developmental delay and macroglossia (large tongue) are also common features in infantile Pompe disease [1].\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **Von Gierke's disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type I)** primarily affects the liver and kidneys, leading to hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and lactic acidosis. While cardiac issues can occur, severe concentric LVH is not a hallmark feature [2].\n*   **Forbes' disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type III)** involves deficiency of debranching enzyme, leading to glycogen accumulation in the liver and muscles. Cardiac involvement can occur, but it's typically less severe and concentric LVH is not as characteristic as in Pompe disease [3].\n*   **McArdle's disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type V)** is a muscle phosphorylase deficiency, primarily affecting skeletal muscle. Symptoms include exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and weakness. Cardiac involvement is rare and not typically characterized by severe concentric LVH in infancy [4, 5].",

Physical examination reveals generalized muscular weakness, a large tongue, and cardiomegaly without significant hea murmurs.

Deficiency of this vitamin can lead to squamous metaplasia of respiratory epithelium, predisposing to infection. Increased keratin buildup leads to follicular plugging and papular dermatosis. Desquamated keratinaceous debris in the urinary tract forms the nidus for stones. Ocular complications of vitamin A deficiency include xerophthalmia and corneal scarring, which can lead to blindness. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency causes problems such as Wernicke disease, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, characterized by bone deformities.

Bladder cancer rates are increased in endemic areas. Salmonella infection concurrent with schistosomiasis is common and is resistant to treatment unless the schistosomiasis is also treated.Diagnosis# Diagnosis of S. japonicum and S. mansoni is by the presence of ova in feces or tissue. Diagnosis of S. haematobium is by the presence of ova in urine or tissue. However, ova loads are not always sufficient for diagnosis, especially in long-standing chronic illness. Immunofluorescent antibody tests and antigen detection assays are increasingly used.# \"Fetal head\" bladder calcification may be shown in X-rays in chronic S. haematobium infection. QTreatment# For S. haematobium and S. mansoni, praziquantel 20/kg po bid for one day; for S. japonica and S. mekongi, praziquantel 20/kg po tid for one day are the treatments of choice.# S. mansoni may also be treated with oxamniquine in a single po dose (with food) of 15 mg/kg. S. haematobium in North and East Africa may be treated with metrifonate 7.5-10 mg/kg every other week for a total of 3 doses.Also Know:# The second most common urologic cancer and the most frequent malignant tumor of the urinary tract is bladder cancer. Usually a transitional cell carcinoma. Most prevalent in men during the sixth and seventh decades. Risk factors include smoking, diets rich in meat and fat, schistosomiasis, chronic treatment with cyclophosphamide, and exposure to aniline dye (a benzene derivative).# Causes of portal hypertesnion are as follows: 1. Presinusoidal: Splenic or portal vein thrombosis, schistosomiasis. granulomatous disease. 2. Sinusoidal: Cirrhosis, granulomatous disease. 3. Postsinusoidal: Right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic vein thrombosis.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the criteria for diagnosing SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) are not fully detailed. However, I can identify which option is *not* a standard SIRS criterion based on general medical knowledge and the typical components of SIRS.\n\nThe standard criteria for SIRS generally include:\n\n*   **Temperature:** Either a core body temperature > 38.5°C or < 36°C [1].\n*   **Heart Rate:** Tachycardia (heart rate > 90 beats/min in adults, or > 2 standard deviations above normal for age in children) [1].\n*   **Respiratory Rate:** Tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min in adults, or > 2 standard deviations above normal for age in children) [1].\n*   **White Blood Cell Count:** Either leukocytosis (WBC count > 12,000/mm³), leukopenia (WBC count < 4,000/mm³), or >10% immature neutrophils (bands) [1].\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. Temp > 38.5 degC or < 36 degC:** This is a standard SIRS criterion [1].\n*   **B. RR > SD above normal for age:** This refers to respiratory rate being significantly elevated above normal for age, which is a standard SIRS criterion [1].\n*   **C. Children <1 year old persistent bradycardia over 0.5 hour:** Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is generally *not* a criterion for SIRS. SIRS is typically associated with tachycardia (fast heart rate) [1].\n*   **D. >50% immature neutrophils:** While a high percentage of immature neutrophils (bands) is a component of the white blood cell count criterion for SIRS (specifically, >10% immature neutrophils), the threshold of \">50%\" is significantly higher than the standard criterion. However, the presence of immature neutrophils is a recognized indicator.\n\nConsidering the options, **C. Children <1 year old persistent bradycardia over 0.5 hour** is the most likely answer as bradycardia is not a typical SIRS criterion, whereas elevated temperature, elevated respiratory rate, and abnormal white blood cell counts (including immature neutrophils) are.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",

      "answer": "Based on the information provided, the diagnosis is **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **X-linked recessive muscle disease:** Duchenne muscular dystrophy is described as an X-linked recessive muscle disease [2].\n*   **Inability to synthesize dystrophin:** The context states that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an inability to synthesize dystrophin, which is crucial for maintaining muscle fiber integrity [2]. The muscle biopsy finding of \"absent of dystrophic\" (likely meaning absent dystrophin) strongly supports this [2].\n*   **Clinical manifestations:** Proximal weakness in the first few years of life, difficulty climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor are all consistent with the early clinical manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [2].\n*   **Age of onset:** The patient is a 4-year-old male, which aligns with the early onset of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nWhile Becker muscular dystrophy is a related condition, it typically has a later onset (usually adolescence) and a slower progression [2]. The other options, Myotonic dystrophy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, are not described in the provided context in a way that would allow for a definitive diagnosis based on the given information.",

      "answer": "Following acute failure of the left ventricle, pulmonary edema generally begins to appear when left atrial pressure approaches 15 mm Hg [2].",
      "ground_truth": "20 mm Hg || Pulmonary edema is one of the most serious consequences of left ventricular cardiac failure. When the left ventricle fails or when the mitral valve fails, left atrial pressure (LAP) may increase substantially. The resulting increase in pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) forces excess fluid filtration through the pulmonary capillary walls and into the lung tissue. At first, the fluid collects within the lung interstitial space. If LAP exceeds a critical level of ~25 mmHg, the volume of edema fluid will overwhelm the capacity of the interstitial spaces and fluid will flood the airways and alveoli (8). This airway edema directly interferes with gas exchange, and it can kill the patient. However, many people live for months or years with modestly elevated LAP (<25 mmHg). We believe that sustained, subcritical LAP elevations lead to two phases of change in the lungs. The first phase is the acute edema that develops in the first few hours of elevated LAP. The second phase concerns the effect of long-term (7 days or more) increases in LAP below the critical level. This review deals with the acute phase and long-term phase changes in the lung caused by modestly elevated LAP. The acute phase of pulmonary edema has been the subject of intense investigation for many years. In 1896, Starling (7) laid the foundation for our current understanding of pulmonary edema with his famous fluid filtration equation. The equation relates the rate of fluid filtration through the capillary wall (Jv) to the pressures across the capillary wall and to the filtration characteristics of the capillary membrane Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition",

Because of their carditoxicity these drugs should be avoided in the patient with MI and CHF.o The antracyclines exert their anticancer activity through four major mechanisms -1. Inhibition of topoisomerase II2. Blockade of synthesis of DNA & RNA, and DNA strand scission.3. Alter fluidity and ion transport.4. Generation of semiquinone free radicals and oxygen free radicals - this free radical mechanism is the cause of cardiotoxicity.o This cardiootoxicity can be prevented by using dexrazoxane (a free radical scavenger) and a-tocopherol.o Liposomal forms of these drugs also reduce cardiac toxicity.o Adverse effects - Dose related myelosuppression with neutropenia, dose limiting mucositis, cardiotoxicity (AI 96, 94, AIIMS 93)o Uses of Doxorubicin# Ca Breast# Ca Endometrium# Ca ovary# Ca testicle# Ca thyroid# Ca lung# Hodgkin s disease# Non Hodgkin disease# Sarcomaso Uses of Daunorubicin# It has far narrower spectrum of activity than Doxorubicin# It is mainly used in acute leukemia.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, edema of the feet is a feature of:\n\n*   **CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)**: This is described as abnormal fluid retention due to impaired cardiac function, characterized by increased venous and capillary pressure, and swollen legs when standing [2]. Swollen legs when standing can include the feet.\n*   **Nephrotic Syndrome**: This condition is characterized by generalized edema [4].\n*   **General Edema**: While not explicitly named as \"edema feet,\" context [3] describes \"an abnormal accumulation of excess fluid in the lower extremity resulting in swelling of the feet and extending upward to the lower leg,\" which is consistent with edema of the feet. Context [5] also mentions \"The accumulation of fluid in the feet, most prominently on the dorsum.\"\n\nThe context does not provide information about **Conn syndrome** or **Hypothyroid** conditions in relation to edema of the feet. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, we cannot definitively say whether edema feet is a feature of these conditions.\n\nHowever, the question asks what edema feet is *not* a feature of. Since CHF and Nephrotic Syndrome are explicitly linked to edema (and generalized edema can include the feet), and the descriptions in [3] and [5] directly mention feet swelling, we can infer that edema feet *is* a feature of these.\n\nWithout further information on Conn syndrome and Hypothyroid, we cannot definitively answer which of the options is *not* a feature. However, if we are to choose from the given options and assume the question implies conditions *mentioned* in the context, then the answer would be one of the conditions not discussed.\n\n**Given the options and the provided context, the most appropriate answer is that edema feet is not a feature of conditions not described in the text.**\n\nIf we are forced to choose from the options and assume the question is testing knowledge beyond the provided text, then this is not possible. However, if the question is strictly based on the provided text, then we can only confirm what *is* a feature.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on what is *explicitly* stated or strongly implied:\n*   CHF: Swollen legs when standing [2] - implies feet.\n*   Nephrotic Syndrome: Generalized edema [4] - implies feet.\n*   [3] and [5] directly describe swelling of the feet.\n\nTherefore, edema feet *is* a feature of CHF and Nephrotic Syndrome. The question asks what it is *not* a feature of.\n\n**Without information on Conn syndrome and Hypothyroid, we cannot definitively answer.**\n\nHowever, if this is a multiple-choice question from a test, and the other options are known to cause edema, then the answer would be the one that doesn't.\n\n**Based on the provided context alone, I cannot definitively answer which of the options is *not* a feature of edema feet.** The context describes edema feet as a feature of conditions related to CHF and Nephrotic Syndrome. Information on Conn syndrome and Hypothyroid is missing.",

However, it does not specify the mechanism of its action in terms of inhibiting Na K ATPase, Ca channels, K channels, or Adenyl cyclase.",
      "ground_truth": "Na K ATPase || Ans: a (Na K ATPase) Ref: Tripathi, 6th ed, p. 499All cardiac glycosides are potent and highly selective inhibitors of the active transport of Na+ and K+ across cell membranes by their reversible binding to the alpha subunit of the. Na+, K+- ATPase the elimination 11 /2 for digoxin is 36 hours in patients with nonnal renal function. Digoxin is excreted by the kidney with a clearance rate that is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. It is now recommended that digoxin be reserved for patients with heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation, or for patients in sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic despite maximal therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and death, from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death.Other than heart failure digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia.ToxicityExtracardiacAnorexia, nausea, vomiting are usually first symptoms of toxicity. Other complaints include fatigue, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, disorientation, psychosis and visual disturbances.CardiacAlmost every type of arrhythmia can be produced by digitalis: pulsus bigeminis, nodal and ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Partial to complete A-V block, severe bradycardia.Atrial extra systoles, AF or atrial flutter have also been noted.Treatmenta) For tachyarrythmias:KC1 infusion 20 m mol /hr IV or give orally in mild cases.b) For ventricular arrythmias: Lidocaine IV repeated as required is the drug of choice.c) For supraventricular arrythmias: Propranolol may be given IV or oral depending on urgencyd) For A-V block and bradycardia: Atropine 0.6-1.2 mg IM may help: otherwise cardiac pacing is recommended.Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug.Immunotherapy with purified Fab fragments from bovine antidigoxin antisera (DIGIBIND) provides an effective antidote for lifethreatening digoxin toxicity.Precautions and contraindicationsHypokalaemia:enhances digitalis toxicityby increasing its binding to Na+ K+ATPase elderly, renal or severe hepatic disease Myocardial infarction: sever arrythmias are more likely thyrotoxicosis-reduces responsiveness to digitalis.Myxedema: these patienst eliminate digoxin more slowly, toxicity can appearVentricular tachycardia:digitalis is contraindicated, may precipitate ventricular fibrillationIt is explicitly contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation",

Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

      "ground_truth": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy || Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid ahritis (RA) are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, hea, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i.e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. You may be tempted to think that this patient is prone to developing hypersensitivity myocarditis, but this form of myocardial disease has been repoed after treatment with some antihypeensive agents,antibiotics, diuretics and not with coicosteroids or NSAIDs. Fuhermore, myocarditis manifests acutely with arrhythmias and hea failure, and chronically with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive hea failure. Ref: Hoit B.D. (2011). Chapter 34.

      "question": "False about pioglitazone? A. It PPARy agonist | B. Metabolized in liver | C. Not given in case of diastolic dysfunction | D. It acts on insulin gene and even in absence of insulin helps in metabolism of carbohydrate",
      "answer": "Based on the provided context, here's an analysis of the options regarding pioglitazone:\n\n*   **A. It PPARy agonist:** Both [1] and [2] state that pioglitazone activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). This means it is a PPARγ agonist. So, this statement is **true**.\n\n*   **B. Metabolized in liver:** The provided text does not mention where pioglitazone is metabolized. It only describes its mechanism of action. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny this statement based on the given context.\n\n*   **C. Not given in case of diastolic dysfunction:** The provided text does not mention any contraindications related to diastolic dysfunction for pioglitazone. However, it does mention that rosiglitazone (another thiazolidinedione) \"may cause fluid retention and may worsen congestive heart failure\" [3]. While not directly about pioglitazone, this suggests potential cardiovascular concerns with this class of drugs. Without specific information on pioglitazone and diastolic dysfunction, we cannot definitively say if this is true or false.\n\n*   **D. It acts on insulin gene and even in absence of insulin helps in metabolism of carbohydrate:** [1] and [2] state that pioglitazone \"modulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes.\" This implies it influences genes related to insulin's action. However, the text does not state that it helps in carbohydrate metabolism *in the absence of insulin*. Its antidiabetic properties are linked to its interaction with insulin-responsive genes and other mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided context, we can definitively say that statement A is true. Statements B and C are not addressed in the text. Statement D is partially supported by the text (acting on insulin-responsive genes) but the claim of helping in carbohydrate metabolism *in the absence of insulin* is not explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is most likely **false** or at least not supported by the provided text is **D**, as the context doesn't confirm it aids carbohydrate metabolism in the complete absence of insulin. However, without further information or clarification on the intended meaning of \"helps in metabolism of carbohydrate\" in the absence of insulin, it's difficult to be absolutely certain.\n\nGiven the options and the provided text, the most accurate answer is that we cannot confirm or deny B and C. Statement A is true. Statement D makes a claim not fully supported by the text.\n\nIf forced to choose the *false* statement based *only* on what is explicitly stated or contradicted, and assuming \"helps in metabolism of carbohydrate\" implies a direct metabolic role independent of insulin signaling pathways that are still active, then **D** is the most likely false statement. The text focuses on modulating insulin-responsive genes, not on independent carbohydrate metabolism.",

      "answer": "The most appropriate immediate therapy for a two-year-old boy with severe anemia (Hb = 2 gm%) and features of congestive heart failure would be **A. Packed cell transfusion**.\n\nSevere anemia, especially with signs of congestive heart failure, indicates a critical need to rapidly increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Packed red blood cells are the most efficient way to achieve this by providing concentrated hemoglobin without significantly increasing the blood volume, which could further strain a failing heart [1].\n\n*   **Packed cell transfusion** directly addresses the low hemoglobin level by providing red blood cells, which carry oxygen. This is crucial for improving tissue oxygenation and alleviating the symptoms of heart failure caused by anemia [1].\n*   **Partial exchange transfusion** is typically used for conditions like hyperbilirubinemia or certain hemolytic anemias where the goal is to remove toxic substances or abnormal cells while simultaneously replacing them with normal blood [2]. It's not the primary choice for simple severe anemia with heart failure.\n*   **Whole blood transfusion** contains red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. While it would increase hemoglobin, it also increases the total blood volume, which could be detrimental in a patient with congestive heart failure [3].\n*   **Parenteral iron injection** is used to treat iron deficiency anemia, but it takes time for the body to produce new red blood cells. This patient requires immediate correction of severe anemia and heart failure symptoms, making iron therapy too slow for immediate management [4, 5].",

      "ground_truth": ">Causes severe hypoglycemia || Causes severe hypoglycemia Diazoxide Diazoxide is a direct acting aeriolar dilator. Diazoxide causes aeriolar dilatation with little effect on veins. Diazoxide prevents smooth muscle contraction and relaxes the aerioles Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator which causes local relaxation in smooth muscle by increasing membrane permeability to potassium ions. This switches off voltage gated calcium ion channel which inhibits the generation of action potential. When used as an intravenous antihypeensive agent diazoxide causes excessive hypotension. Diazoxide was formerlyused as an intravenous bolus dose for the at of hypeensive emergencies. But the dangers of excessive hypotension are now recognized to outweigh the benefit, and its emergency use is obsolete. Hypotension due to diazoxide has resulted in stroke and myocardial infarction. - The reflex sympathetic response due to hypotension can provoke angina, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and cardiac failure in patients with ischemic hea disease and diazoxide should be avoided in this situation. Diazoxide produces hyperglycemia by increasing insulin secretion, therefore it is used to treat various forms of hypoglycemia Diazoxide activates the same potassium channel in the pancreatic islet cells that is blocked by sulfonylureas. SullOnylureas close the potassium channels and increase insulin secretion whereas diazoxide opens the potassium channel in pancreatic islet cells and decrease insulin secretion. Due to its hyperglycemic action it is a useful drug for patients with chronic hypoglycemia from excess endogenous insulin secretion, either from an iselt cell tumour (insulinoma) or islet cell hyperplasia. According to Lawerence Diazoxide stimulates the ATP dependent r channel that is blocked by the sulphonylureas. Therefore its chronic use as an antihypeensive agent is precluded by the development of diabetes. Indeed its use in therapeutics should now be confined to rare indication of treating hypoglycemia due to islet cell tumour (insulinoma). Diazoxide is chemically related to thiazide diuretics. But in contrast to the structurally related thiazide diuretics, diazoxide causes renal salt and water retention.",

It dilates veins and arterioles, thereby reducing pre-load and left ventricular impedance without rise in heart rate and renin secretion. It also inhibits sympathetic outflow in central nervous system. It enhances insulin secretion, which is inhibited by venom action. It has also been found useful even in cases with hypotension.

      "ground_truth": "Productive cough || Ans. is 'd' i.e., Productive cough Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug and thus blocks potassium channel. It acts by increasing the action potential duration and effective refractory period.In spite of its present classification as class 3 drug, amiodarone also significantly blocks inactivated sodium channels. It also has weak adrenergic and calcium channel blocking actions.Consequence of these actions include slowing of the heart rate and AV node conduction.Amiodarone is the most powerful antiarrhythmic drug available for the treatment and prevention of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.Adverse effect:-Even short term use of Amiodarone causes serious toxicity.Amiodarone accumulates in many tissues which includes heart, lung, liver and skin.Pulmonary toxicityIt is the most important adverse effect.It is dose related. Fatal pulmonary fibrosis may be observed even in low doses.Patient usually presents with cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Symptoms usually start with dry cough and dyspnoea. Remember, that patients on amiodarone often have dyspnoea attributable to other problems such as heart failure, so amiodarone lung toxicity is difficult to diagnose.Liver toxicityAbnormal liver function and hepatitis develops during amiodarone therapy. (I have not got any documented evidence of liver cirrhosis).Skin depositsSkin deposits results in photodermatitis and gray blue skin discoloration in sun exposed areas e.g. the malar region.Corneal micro depositsCorneal micro deposits are seen in virtually all patients treated with Amiodarone after few weeks of treatment.Sometimes optic neuritis may develop and progress to blindness.Effect of Amiodarone on ThyroidAmiodarone is a potential source of large amount of inorganic iodine and it also blocks the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).Thus Amiodarone may result in hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.Thyroid function should be evaluated prior to initiation of treatment and monitored periodically.Cardiac toxicityAmiodarone may produce symptomatic bradycardia and heart block in patients with preexisting sinus or A-V node disease.",

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n*   **B. Systolic ventricular dysfunction is absent:** The context describes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a form of \"CARDIAC MUSCLE disease, characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy\" [1]. While it doesn't explicitly state \"systolic ventricular dysfunction is absent,\" the presence of hypertrophy in the cardiac muscle implies potential dysfunction. However, the context *doesn't* directly confirm or deny the absence of systolic ventricular dysfunction.\n\n*   **C. Anterior leaflet movement is delayed:** The provided context does not contain any information about the movement of the anterior leaflet.\n\n*   **D. Cardiac output is diminished:** The context mentions \"normal or reduced left ventricular volume\" [1]. Reduced left ventricular volume can lead to diminished cardiac output. Therefore, this statement is likely true.\n\nSince the question asks for the statement that is *except* true, and the context does not provide information to confirm or deny statement B or C, we cannot definitively answer based solely on the provided text. However, if we assume that the question implies that the other options are directly supported by the text, then we would need more information to identify the exception.\n\n**Without further context or clarification, it is not possible to definitively answer which statement is true except for the others.**",

Chest x-ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe (RLL) and a free-flowing right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis is performed, and the pleural fluid has the following characteristics:Cell count=1110/mm3Glucose=75 mg/dL (serum glucose=85 mg/dL)Protein=4.0 g/dL (serum protein=7.0 g/dL)LDH=400 U/Lserum LDH=200 U/L, normal=100-200 U/LpH=7.35What is the pathogenesis of the pleural effusion? A. Increase in hydrostatic pressure | B. Decrease in oncotic pressure | C. Increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries | D. Bacterial infection in the pleural space",
      "answer": "The pathogenesis of the pleural effusion in this case is likely due to **increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries** [4].\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Pleural effusion is a sign of disease, not a diagnosis itself** [4]. The patient's symptoms (cough, rigors, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and chest x-ray findings (consolidation of the right lower lobe and pleural effusion) suggest an underlying inflammatory or infectious process.\n*   The characteristics of the pleural fluid are crucial for determining the cause. The fluid is described as having a high protein level (4.0 g/dL compared to serum 7.0 g/dL) and a high LDH level (400 U/L compared to serum 200 U/L). These findings, particularly the elevated protein and LDH, are indicative of an **exudative effusion**.\n*   Exudative effusions are typically caused by inflammation or infection that increases the permeability of the pleural membranes, allowing protein-rich fluid and inflammatory cells to leak into the pleural space [4].\n*   While an increase in hydrostatic pressure (A) or a decrease in oncotic pressure (B) can cause transudative effusions, the fluid characteristics here point away from these mechanisms.\n*   A bacterial infection in the pleural space (D) is a possible cause of an exudative effusion, but the question asks about the *pathogenesis* of the effusion itself, which is the increased permeability of the capillaries. The bacterial infection would be the underlying cause leading to this increased permeability.\n\nTherefore, the most direct answer describing the mechanism by which the fluid accumulates in the pleural space, given the exudative nature of the effusion, is the increased permeability of the visceral pleural membrane capillaries [4].",
      "ground_truth": "Increased permeability of visceral pleural membrane capillaries || Clinical conditions associated with either an increase in hydrostatic pressure (such as congestive heart failure) or a decrease in oncotic pressure (such as nephrotic syndrome) are associated with transudative pleural effusions. This patient's pleural fluid is exudative by all three of the Light criteria: pleural fluid/serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5, pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio is greater than 0.6, and pleural fluid LDH is greater than two-thirds the upper limits of the normal serum LDH. The most likely explanation for an exudative pleural effusion in the setting of an acute pneumonia is a parapneumonic effusion. Parapneumonic effusions occur in about 40% of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Parapneumonic effusions are exudative due to the fact that there is increased permeability of the visceral pleural membrane capillaries, and interstitial fluid moves across the visceral pleura into the pleural space. Parapneumonic effusions may be simple or complicated. Simple parapneumonic effusions are sterile and free flowing. If bacteria invade the pleural space, neutrophils move into the pleural space and anaerobic metabolism of glucose results in a low pleural fluid pH (<7.20) and glucose (<60). The characteristics of this patient's pleural fluid suggest that bacterial invasion of the pleural space has not occurred, and that this is a simple parapneumonic effusion. Hemorrhage into the pleural space occurs with trauma, cancer, and pulmonary embolism, but rarely with pneumonia.",

(Ref KDT 6th/pg. 19; Harrison's 17th edition, page 29)APPARENT VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION (Theoretical volume occupied by the total absorbed drug amount at the plasma concentration.)# Vd = amount of drug in the body / plasma drug concentrationFactors governing the volume of drug distribution:# Lipid: Water partition Co-efficient of the drug: Lipid insoluble drugs do not enter cells - V approximates extracellular fluid volume, e.g. streptomycin, gentamicin 0.25L/kg.# pKa value of the drug.# Degree of plasma protein binding: The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume (are largely restricted to the vascular compartment) and hence have low V values e.g. diclofenac and warfarin (99% bound) V = 0.15L/kg.# Affinity for different tissues: By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. Thus, drugs sequestrated in tissues may have, V much more than total body water or even body mass, e.g. digoxin 6 L/kg, propranolol 4L/kg, morphine 3.5 L/kg, because most of the drug is present in other tissues and plasma concentration is low.

The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is an example. By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume of distribution of digoxin and tricyclic antidepressants is hundreds of liters, obviously exceeding total-body volume. Such drugs are not readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose.Only when distribution is near-complete does the concentration of digoxin in plasma reflect pharmacologic effect. For this reason, there should be a 6-8 h wait after administration before plasma levels of digoxin are measured as a guide to therapy.Educational pointsClinical Implications of Altered Protein BindingThe acute-phase reactant ?l-acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs, such as lidocaine or quinidine, and is increased in a range of common conditions, including myocardial infarction, surgery, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and burns. This increased binding can lead to reduced pharmacologic effects at therapeutic concentrations of total drug. Conversely, conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, liver disease, and renal disease can decrease the extent of drug binding, particularly of acidic and neutral drugs, such as phenytoin. Here, plasma concentration of free drug is increased, so drug efficacy and toxicity are enhanced if total (free + bound) drug concentration is used to monitor therapy.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the clinical diagnosis is **B.

Abnormal rhythm of the heart is also mentioned [3].\n*   **Ascites:** This is a symptom that can be associated with conditions affecting the heart's ability to pump effectively.\n*   **Small heart with calcification seen on the lateral view (chest X-ray):** Calcification of the pericardium is a hallmark of constrictive pericarditis.\n*   **Low QRS voltage (12-lead ECG):** This finding is also characteristic of constrictive pericarditis, as the thickened and calcified pericardium can impede the electrical signals of the heart.\n\nWhile the context doesn't explicitly detail all the symptoms of each differential diagnosis, the combination of a rapid, irregular pulse, ascites, calcification on X-ray, and low QRS voltage on ECG strongly points towards constrictive pericarditis.",

Bronchial asthma**.\n\nWhile the context does not explicitly state contraindications, it mentions that propranolol is a non-cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that acts on both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors [1, 3]. Beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs and their blockade can lead to bronchoconstriction. Therefore, conditions like bronchial asthma, where airway constriction is a concern, would likely be a contraindication for non-cardioselective beta-blockers.\n\nThe other options are conditions for which beta-blockers are used:\n*   **A. Glaucoma:** Beta-blockers are used as antiglaucoma agents [3, 5].\n*   **B. Tachycardia:** Beta-blockers are used to treat arrhythmias, which can include tachycardia.\n*   **D.

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, none of the options directly explain what causes thirst. However, we can infer a potential link through the information about angiotensin II and aldosterone.\n\nAngiotensin II plays a role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. When angiotensin II levels are high, it can stimulate aldosterone secretion, which leads to sodium and water retention [2, 3]. Conversely, a decrease in plasma levels of angiotensin II would likely lead to decreased aldosterone secretion, promoting sodium and water excretion [2, 3]. This would suggest a potential for dehydration and, consequently, thirst.\n\nWhile not explicitly stated as a cause of thirst, the other options are less directly related:\n*   **Cardiac failure** can lead to fluid retention, not necessarily thirst.\n*   **Distension of the cardiac atria** is related to blood volume and can influence hormone release, but the direct link to thirst isn't provided.\n*   **Distension of the stomach** is related to food intake and satiety, not directly to thirst.\n\nTherefore, while not definitively answered by the text, **B. Decreased plasma levels of angiotensin II** has the most plausible indirect connection to thirst due to its role in fluid and electrolyte balance.",

Beta-blockers generally slow heart rate and conduction. Partial heart block involves impaired conduction. Therefore, it's plausible that partial heart block might be an exception or even a contraindication. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a condition where beta-blockers are sometimes used to reduce contractility and heart rate, but their role can be complex.\n\nGiven this, and the lack of explicit mention, **B. Partial heart block** is a strong candidate for an exception.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",

      "answer": "Based on the information provided, a weaker femoral pulse compared to the radial pulse in an infant presenting with cardiac failure suggests a diagnosis of **Coarctation of the Aorta (COA)** [3].\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Coarctation of the Aorta (COA)** is a congenital narrowing of the aorta, typically occurring just after the origin of the left subclavian artery. This narrowing obstructs blood flow to the lower body. As a result, blood pressure and pulses in the lower extremities (like the femoral pulse) are significantly weaker than in the upper extremities (like the radial pulse) [3]. Infants with significant coarctation often present with signs of cardiac failure [3].\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely based on this specific finding:\n\n*   **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)**: A PDA is an abnormal connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. While it can lead to cardiac failure, it typically results in bounding pulses in both upper and lower extremities due to the continuous flow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery [1].\n*   **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)**: A VSD is a hole between the ventricles. Large VSDs can cause cardiac failure, but they don't typically cause a differential in pulse strength between the upper and lower extremities in the way described [2].\n*   **Aorto-illiac vasculitis**: While vasculitis can affect blood vessels, it's not the most common cause of this specific pulse discrepancy in infants presenting with cardiac failure. Coarctation of the aorta is a much more frequent congenital anomaly that directly explains this finding [3].",
      "ground_truth": "COA || Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics. 19th Edition.Explanation:Weak femoral pulse is indicative of Coarctation of aorta. Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. Weak femoral pulse or femoral pulse felt after radial pulse is a characteristic feature of COACoarctation of aorta (COA)Constrictions of the aorta of varying degrees may occur at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation, hut 98% occur just below the origin of the left subclavian artery at the origin of the ductus arteriosus i juxtaductal coarctation).The anomaly occurs twice as often in males as in females.Coarctation of the aorta may be a feature of Turner syndrome and is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve in more than 70% of patients.Mitral valve abnormalities (a supravalvular mitral ring or parachute mitral valve) and subaortic stenosis are potential associated lesions.When this group of left-sided obstructive lesions occurs together, they are referred to as the Shone complex.Clinical ManifestationsMostly asymptomaticSome children or adolescents complain about weakness or pain in the legs after exerciseSilent hypertension diagnosed on routine physical examination.Disparity in pulsation and blood pressure in the arms and legs.The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibia], and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in up to 40%' of patients), in contrast to the bounding pulses of the arms and carotid vessels.The radial and femoral pulses should always be palpated simultaneously for the presence of a radial-femora] delay.Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. A radial-femoral delay occurs when blood flow to the descending aorta is dependent on collaterals, in which case the femora] pulse is felt after the radial pulse.In normal persons, systolic blood pressure in the legs obtained by the cuff method is 10-20 mm Hg higher than that in the arms.In coarctation of the aorta, blood pressure in the legs is lower than that in the arms.The precordial impulse and heart sounds are usually normal.The presence of a systolic ejection click or thrill in the suprasternal notch suggests a bicuspid aortic valve (present in 709c of cases).A short systolic murmur is often heard along the left sternal border at the 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces.In older patients with well-developed collateral blood flow, systolic or continuous murmurs may be heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly. (SUZMAN SIGN)In these patients, a palpable thri 11 can occasionally be appreciated in the intercostal spaces on the back.DiagnosisCardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion are noted in infants with severe coarctation.The enlarged left subclavian artery commonly produces a prominent shadow in the left superior mediastinum.Notching of the inferior border of the ribs from pressure erosion by enlarged collateral vessels is common by late childhood.In most instances, the descending aorta has an area of poststenotic dilatation.",

      "ground_truth": "Marfan's Syndrome || Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues,manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes,and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheri- tance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix . These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromo- somes 15q21.1 and 5q23.31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administrationof antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Clinical Features. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less impoant than aoic lesions. Loss of connective tissue suppo in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve . Valvular lesions, along with lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aoic valves. Echocardiography greatly enhances the ability to detect the cardiovascular abnormalities and is therefore extremely valuable in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The great majority of deaths are caused by rupture of aoic dissections, followed in impoance by cardiac failure. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 145",

She was treated for multiple bone metastases with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil for 6 months. She is complaining of exeion on exercise, swelling of the legs, and swelling around eyes in the morning. On examination, she has bilateral rales in the lungs, Sl, S2 audible, S3, S4 gallop present. Her BP is 149/117 mm Hg, PR is 80/min, and RR is 18/min. What is the most likely cause for her cardiac condition? A. Systolic dysfunction CHF | B. Drug induced cardiac toxicity | C. Metastatic cardiac disease | D. Pneumonia",
      "answer": "Based on the provided information, the most likely cause for her cardiac condition is **B. Drug induced cardiac toxicity** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **History of Chemotherapy:** The patient received treatment with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin for 6 months [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Both of these drugs are known to have cardiotoxic effects, which can manifest as heart failure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Doxorubicin, in particular, is a well-established cause of dose-dependent cardiotoxicity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n*   **Symptoms:** Her symptoms of \"exeion on exercise, swelling of the legs, and swelling around eyes in the morning\" are consistent with heart failure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n*   **Physical Examination Findings:** The presence of bilateral rales in the lungs, S3 and S4 gallop, and elevated blood pressure (149/117 mm Hg) are also indicative of cardiac dysfunction and fluid overload, which are hallmarks of heart failure [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nWhile other options might be considered in a broader differential, they are less likely given the specific history:\n\n*   **A. Systolic dysfunction CHF:** While she likely has systolic dysfunction contributing to her CHF, the *cause* of that dysfunction is most strongly suggested by her chemotherapy history.\n*   **C. Metastatic cardiac disease:** While possible, there's no direct mention of cardiac metastases in the context, and the cardiotoxic effects of her prior treatment are a more direct and probable explanation for her current symptoms.\n*   **D. Pneumonia:** While rales can be present in pneumonia, the constellation of symptoms, physical findings (especially the gallops and elevated BP), and the strong history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy make drug-induced cardiac toxicity the leading diagnosis.",

      "ground_truth": "Copper || Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Hea: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",

This directly aligns with the postmortem finding of interventricular septal hypertrophy.\n*   While the context doesn't explicitly mention sudden cardiac arrest in athletes as a direct outcome, HCM is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals, particularly during or after strenuous physical activity [1].\n*   The term \"Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)\" is a specific type of HCM where the hypertrophy obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle. The presence of hypertrophy itself points strongly towards HCM.\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely based on the provided information:\n\n*   **A. Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM):** DCM is characterized by left ventricular dilation, which is the opposite of the hypertrophy described in the context [2].\n*   **C.

The bilateral rales in the lungs also indicate fluid accumulation, a common consequence of impaired cardiac function [1].\n*   **Physical Examination Findings:** The presence of S3 and S4 gallops on examination are indicative of abnormal heart sounds often associated with heart failure [1]. Her elevated blood pressure (149/117 mm Hg) could be a contributing factor or a consequence of her cardiac condition [1].\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A.

During acute therapy ECG changes occur in 30% of patients and usually regress in weeks. The occurrence of early ECG abnormalities does not predict cardiomyopathy and is not an indication to discontinue therapy.

      "ground_truth": "To evaluate unstable angina || Ref: KV Krishna Das - Clinical Medicine 4th Edition pg no:212 Exercise Electrocardiography (Syn: Stress Tests, Treadmill Test) This refers to the recording of the electrical activity of the hea while the individual is subjected to the stress of graded exercises. The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic hea disease, valvular hea disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic hea disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypeension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade hea blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the hea rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease. In patients with ischemic hea disease, positive stress test is an indication for fuher tests such as coronary angiography.",

He has prominent aoic ejection click and murmurs heard over the ribs on the both sides anteriorly and over the back posterioly. In addition.the pulses in the lower extremities are feeble and he complains of mild claudication with exeion. The most likely diagnosis is A. Aial septal defect | B. Aoic stenosis | C. Coarctation of the aoa | D. Cardiomyopathy",
      "answer": "The most likely diagnosis for a 27-year-old man with a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg, prominent aortic ejection click and murmurs heard over the ribs anteriorly and posteriorly, feeble pulses in the lower extremities, and mild claudication with exertion is **C. Coarctation of the aorta** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Hypertension:** The significantly elevated blood pressure (170/100 mmHg) is a hallmark of coarctation of the aorta, as the narrowing restricts blood flow, leading to increased pressure in the upper body [1, 2, 3].\n*   **Aortic Ejection Click and Murmurs:** While an aortic ejection click can be heard in aortic stenosis, the location of the murmurs over the ribs anteriorly and posteriorly, along with the other findings, points more strongly towards coarctation [2, 3, 5]. The murmurs are often heard best over the scapulae in coarctation [2].\n*   **Diminished Lower Extremity Pulses and Claudication:** The feeble pulses in the lower extremities and the complaint of mild claudication with exertion are classic signs of reduced blood flow to the legs due to the aortic narrowing [1, 3, 4]. This is a key differentiating factor from other conditions.\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Septal Defect (ASD):** ASDs typically present with a fixed splitting of the second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border. They do not usually cause significant hypertension or diminished lower extremity pulses [1].\n*   **B. Aortic Stenosis:** While aortic stenosis can cause an ejection click and murmurs, it typically leads to a pressure gradient across the aortic valve, causing symptoms like chest pain, syncope, and heart failure. It doesn't characteristically cause diminished pulses in the lower extremities or hypertension in the upper extremities to this degree [1, 2].\n*   **D. Cardiomyopathy:** Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle itself and can lead to various symptoms including heart failure, arrhythmias, and chest pain. However, they do not typically present with the specific combination of upper body hypertension, diminished lower extremity pulses, and murmurs heard in the described locations [1].",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, the important clues for diagnosing chronic renal failure (CRF) are related to the kidneys' reduced activity over time and the degree of kidney damage.\n\nWhile the context doesn't explicitly list all the options provided in the question, it does mention:\n\n*   **Reduced kidney activity below normal for more than three months** as a defining characteristic of chronic renal failure [2].\n*   **The degree of damage to the kidney, as measured by the level of proteinuria**, is used to classify CRF [2]. This suggests that **massive proteinuria** (option B) would be an important clue.\n*   The context also mentions **stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease** and **stage 5 chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease** [4, 5]. This implies that the **severity of the kidney disease**, which is often associated with progressive damage and reduced function, is a key diagnostic factor.\n\nThe context does not directly mention \"Bilateral contracted kidney\" (A), \"Osteodystrophy\" (C), or \"Hypertension\" (D) as direct clues for diagnosis. However, hypertension is a common cause and consequence of chronic kidney disease [4, 5]. Osteodystrophy is a known complication of chronic kidney disease due to impaired calcium and phosphate metabolism, and bilateral contracted kidneys are a common finding in advanced chronic kidney disease.\n\nGiven the information available in the context, the most directly supported clue for diagnosis is **B. Massive proteinuria** [2]. The other options are generally associated with chronic renal failure but are not explicitly detailed as diagnostic clues within the provided text.\n\nTherefore, based *solely* on the provided context, the answer is not definitively determinable for all options.

Early primary coronary intervention is a procedure aimed at directly addressing this interruption by opening blocked coronary arteries.",
      "ground_truth": "Early primary coronary intervention || Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (\u00011 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mmHg, hea rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

But thiazides rarely cause hypercalcemia as a result of this enhanced reabsorption, they can unmask hypercalcemia due to other causes.This effect on calcium makes them useful in the t/t of kidney stones caused by idiopathic hypercalciuria.Major indications of thiazide diuretics:-HypertensionHeart failureNephrolithiasis due to idiopathic hypercalciuriaNephrogenic diabetes insipidusAdverse effect of thiazide diuretics Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosisDue to the action of thiazides, more salts are delivered to the collecting tubule. Increased delivery leads to increased secretion of K+ and H+ by the duct causing hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.Impaired carbohydrate tolerance (Hyperglycemia)Hyperglycemia may occur in patients who are overtly diabetic or who have even mildly abnormal glucose tolerance tests.The effect is due to both impaired pancreatic release of insulin and diminished utilization of glucose. HyperlipidemiaThiazides cause a 5-15% increase in total serum cholesterol and low density lipoproteins (LDL) HyperuricemiaThiazides cause increased reabsorption of uric acid.HyponatremiaIt is due to combination of hypovolemia induced elevation of ADH, reduction in the diluting capacity of the kidney and increased thirst.Allergic reactionsThe thiazides are sulfonamides and they share cross-relativity with other members of this group.
